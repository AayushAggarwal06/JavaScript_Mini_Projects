# ðŸ”¢ Counter App â€“ JavaScript Mini Project

A beginner-friendly **Counter App** that demonstrates the power of JavaScript with basic DOM interaction. This is a part of my ongoing journey to master JavaScript through small, practical mini-projects.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This

After practicing core JavaScript logic in the console, I wanted to start interacting with the **browser UI** â€” and this simple counter is the perfect stepping stone.

The goal was to understand:

- How JavaScript connects to HTML using the **DOM (Document Object Model)**
- How to dynamically **change content** on a webpage
- How to use **event listeners** to respond to button clicks

This app sets the stage for more advanced UI-based projects by introducing me to the basic mechanics of user interaction.

## ðŸš€ What It Does

The Counter App allows you to:

- **Increase** the count by 1
- **Decrease** the count by 1
- **Reset** the count back to 0

The interface updates **live** as you click buttons.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- DOM Selection with `getElementById`
- Event Handling using `addEventListener`
- Updating the `textContent` of an HTML element
- Variables and state management (`let count`)
- Basic styling and responsive layout with CSS
