# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors Game

A fun and simple Rock Paper Scissors game built with JavaScript — using user prompts and random logic. No HTML buttons or DOM required!

## 🎮 How It Works

- The player is prompted to enter `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
- The game compares both choices and declares the result.
- After each round, the player can choose to play again.

## 💡 Concepts Used

- JavaScript `prompt()` and `alert()` for user interaction
- Conditional logic (if-else)
- Arrays and `Math.random()` for computer choice
- While loop to enable replay mode
